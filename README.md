# SEIR-model
SEIR-model Covid-19 (also COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019, which means coronavirus disease 2019) is a highly infectious disease that is caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The first was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Since then, the virus has spread around the world, which could be the same as in the case of pandemics. 


The objective of this study was to develop a modified SEIR mathematical model for prediction of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics considering different intervention scenarios which might give insights on the best interventions to reduce the epidemic risk. This model is just theoretical model, which doesnÂ´t show and predict the real situation. The model is applayed on population of Czech Republic. The model has to be tuned and fitted on real data. It is written in python.
